					<h2>Algemeen verhaal</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Airplanes are used by everyone today. We use it to transport people and get cargo to the right place. After all, you can be in Paris within a few hours 'if it isn't a pain at Schiphol'. In other words, this innovation is life-changing for everyone in this world, both positive and negative. Planes come in different shapes and sizes, you have for example jumbo jets, private jets, fighter jets and you name them.

					<h2>Welk probleem lost het op&#63;</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					The problem this innovation solves is traveling for days to a destination that is further away. Normally it would take you more than a day by car to Spain, by plane this can be done within a few hours. It is now also much easier to send goods over longer distances. Normally this would take weeks, but now it can be done within a few days or if you are very lucky within a day.

					<h2>Hoe moet je het gebruiken?</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					An airplane uses a combination of lift power and speed to get into the air. A pilot can control an airplane with a joystick. This in turn controls components such as aileron, elevator and rudder. An aircraft also has a throttle, with which the pilot can determine how fast he wants the aircraft to fly. Furthermore, there are different types of propulsion that an aircraft can provide with propeller propulsion, jet propulsion, no propulsion.

					<h2>Wie gebruikt het&#63;</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Anyone can use an airplane, although you have to pay a lot for it. However, many also own a private jet. This way they do not have to stand in long queues and they do not have to worry about an overcrowded plane. However, they must hope that there is a space available to take off, otherwise you will not get anywhere. Although it is handy to have wings and wheels

					<h2>Wat kan je ervan verwachten&#63;</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					On an airplane you can generally expect to get a tight seat and always get into an argument with the person next to you. There is also a catering on board where you can buy food and drinks, but this is always very pricey and is therefore not recommended to buy anything from it. If you pay more, however, you can get more luxurious seats and no hassle around you.

					<h2>De toekomst</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Air traffic is expected to decrease in the coming years. Many people are increasingly aware of the environment and are increasingly looking for more sustainable alternatives. In addition, rising fuel prices also play a role, which makes the tickets more expensive and scares passengers away. Perhaps electric aircraft will play a role in the future, but it is highly doubtful whether this will actually happen. There are also tests with nitrogen.
